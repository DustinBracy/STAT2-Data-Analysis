## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#reading in 'Bank Additional' file
bank = read.csv(file.choose(),header = TRUE, sep = ";")
str(bank)
summary(bank)
```

```{r}
#reading in 'Bank Additional Full' file
bankfull = read.csv(file.choose(),header = TRUE, sep = ";")
str(bankfull)
summary(bankfull)
```

```{r}


```{r}
